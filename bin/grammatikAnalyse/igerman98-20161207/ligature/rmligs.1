.SH NAME
rmligs \- remove incorrectly used ligatures from German LaTeX documents
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rmligs
.RB [ options ]
.I FILE(s) ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B rmligs
is a program for removing incorrectly used ligatures from LaTeX documents.
This version is intended for German language texts only. Words like
\`Auflage\' e.g. will be changed to \`Auf"|lage\' which is typographically
correct.
.PP
The wordlist data is based on the igerman98 dictionary.
.PP
The input data may be ISO\-8859\-1/15 or UTF\-8 encoded text. Also the German
LaTeX like encoding of umlauts ("a, "u etc.) is treated correctly.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.IP \-\-filter,\ \-f
filter mode. This is useful for streaming.
.IP \-\-test,\ \-t
test mode. This just shows what would be changed but nothing will be
written (read\-only). This does not make sense in filter mode.
.IP \-\-interactive,\ \-i
prompt before applying changes
.IP \-\-quiet,\ \-q
quiet operation

.SH BUGS
There is no sanity checking of LaTeX files; rmligs will happily correct
words in all files \- even binaries! For safety reasons there is always
a .bak file created.
.PP
checking latin1 text in UTF\-8 locales might throw out some error
messages about malformed UTF\-8 but that does not matter \- the file is
processed correctly.
