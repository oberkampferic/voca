Capitalisazion of `ß' is `SS'. (Before the orthography reform `SZ' was used in
cases where there could be misunderstandings like in `Busse' and 'Buße'.)
Ispell can't do this correctly.

Words like `schreckenerregend' are now usually written `Schrecken erregend'.
`schreckenerregend' is in the dictionary anyway because a comparison is
written `äußerst schreckenerregend' (see R40, Duden). So this is is no bug
but a feature! :)

The file `fixwords' contains a number of redundant words which are necessary
because Ispell otherwise produces strange error messages while building the
hashfile. (not at the moment: 2007-08)
