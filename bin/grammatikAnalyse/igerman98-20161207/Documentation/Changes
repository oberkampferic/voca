since 20110609:
- new words
- new bug fix release 0.87 of rmligs

since 20090107:
- new words
- on systems without ispell one can use "make AFFIX_EXPANDER=aspell foo" to
  build dictionaries that need affix expansion to be built

since 20081106:
- fix build on the less GNUish systems where wc -l outputs leading whitespace
- some words added

since 20071211:
- fix a wrong encoded umlaut and enhance the check for that in the Makefile
- words added and shifted around
- additionaly put the dictionary under GPLv3
- allow Ispell F prefix flag to be combined with suffixes
- eliminate absolutely useless G flag (prefix ge)
- deactivate K suffix flag: unused
- eliminate H suffix flag: was almost unused
- remove Q and q redundancy: every Q flagged word needs a q now, too
- fix build issue with de_CH hunspell dictionary (a missing ß/ss conversion)
- better empty-line fault tolerance of dictionaries
- revise the aspell Makefile target using the myspell format now for aspell
- simplify W flag
- use sha256 checksums and prevent checksumming temporary files

since 20070829:
- words added and shifted around
- Hunspell affix fix

since 20030222:
- in order to make use of Hunspell's compound word support, categorise noun
  word lists into compoundable end and non-end words.
- add blacklists to prevent by compound rules wrongly accepted words to be
  accepted
- add Binnen-I support
- add "nosuggest" flag used by Hunspell to some words where it's appropriate
- in order to support as well Hunspell optimized dictionary builts and ispell
  and myspell builts, a complete Makefile rewrite was done. The Makefile might
  now require GNU make, sorry if that causes trouble. The good news is that
  makefile dependencies are clean now and make -j is possible
- igerman98 names the Ispell dictionaries after ISO 639 language codes now 
  (de_{AT,CH,DE}.{aff,hash})
- isowordlist is obsoleted by isowordlist-de_{AT,CH,DE} now

since 20021114:
- "Wiederstand ist zwecklos" (thanks to Roland Wingerter) and minor
  other fixes
- some fem. flags added

since 20011124:
- plenty of new words
- now requires Ispell >3.1.20 as workarounds for old versions are removed
- myspell (OpenOffice) support
- more subdictionaries enabled by default
- J flag slightly extended
- new zahlen.txt
- reworked "/SJ" flagged words
- now use munchlist, because this eliminates hash problems
- as I switched to UTF-8 locales I needed UTF-8 support for Ispell: -T utf8
  now works for UTF-8 encoded texts, though using Ispell interactively
  still shows some missing support but no big problem
- updated rmligs which is also UTF-8 capable now

since 20010414:
many new words, esp. imperative and subjunctive forms (many \/.*Z.* got an
E), some word fixes and a small /M fix in affix file, extended Makefile to
support DESTDIR and check for illegal characters, new typo file with
trap words that should never get into the dict ;)

since 20000710:

someone prefers this

since 19991219:
new words added and hundreds of words fixed, introduced (still quite empty)
medizin.txt dictionary, a whole bunch of `austriazimen' added, LC_* variables

less insane wordlists, nicer directory structure, minor other changes
