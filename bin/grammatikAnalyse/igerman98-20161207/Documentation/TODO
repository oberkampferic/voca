I'm looking for a spell checker that allows _only certain words_ to be
run-together words ... perhaps Aspell will make some progress here ... That
would mean that this dictionary will have to be totally reworked but
otherwise we will never get really satisfying results with spell checking
German texts.

Anverwandlung ?

compount word stuff:
All ...
Alt ...
Bekannt...
...schaft (als Komp lassen oder nicht?)
...er-weise (spannenderweise etc.)
...treue (wie moskautreue)

* Wishlist for ispell: *
************************

- spell checking ought to be ``one step ahead'' (ispell needs to be
  multithreaded!)
- progress meter (how much of the text has been done?)
- enlarged array (256 or so) for `stringchars'
- undo / redo
- a way to force Capitalization (lowerization) via flags in the aff-file
  (for example by ``flag ^J'' ???)
- the TeX `ligature suppressor' (\/ and "|) and TeX-hints for hyphenation
  like "- or \- should be ignored inside words ("| and "- are german.sty only,
  so a type of ``ignorechar'' for the aff-file could make this job?)
- indicator to see that ispell is working (searching), for example a
  rotating "|" so that the user doesn't press <space> twice
- assume this:
   flag X:
       U SS > -USS,U"SSE
   ... this will lead to NÜSSE in spite of Nüsse :-(
   words that are affix-replaced up to the first character are written
   CAPITALIZED and not Capitalized as they ought to be. (corrected in versions
   after 3.1.20)
- some color would be nice ... perhaps
- any solution for SS sS Ss problem (capitalisazion of ß)
- a possibility to allow "compound words" only for special words, what
  means that "compound words" should be switched on by a flag for words that
  need it. Furthermore the "compound word" feature should be split. It should
  be possible to specify if there can be put other words in front of a
  `compword' or only after a `compword'. Commercial spell checkers have the
  same feature build in. With this feature it is possible to allow words like
  "Markt" to be appended to any other word. Otherwise the dictionary needs to
  know about all "...markt" words or we need to allow "compound words" for all
  words which really is no good idea.
- BUG: why does ispell with the igerman98 20011124 suggest "aufblickten"?
